It provides an intuitive way to work with property graphs. Getting started Take a look at the following guides if you are new to the Cypher query language: Clauses The Cypher language enables users to perform standard database operations by using the following clauses: Functions Cypher supports a large number of functions. The list can be found here:  Other features The following sections describe some of the other supported features in Memgraph: Differences Although we try to implement openCypher query language as closely to the
language reference as possible, we had to make some changes to enhance the
user experience. You can find the differences in this article. Documentation Community More
Differences Although we try to implement openCypher query language as closely to the
language reference as possible, we had to make some changes to enhance the
user experience. Unicode codepoints in string literals Use \u followed by 4 hex digits in string literals for UTF-16 codepoint and
\U with 8 hex digits for UTF-32 codepoint in Memgraph. Difference from Neo4j's Cypher implementation The openCypher initiative stems from Neo4j's Cypher query language. Following is a list
of most important differences between Neo's Cypher and Memgraph's openCypher implementation,
for users that are already familiar with Neo4j. There might be other differences not documented
here (especially subtle semantic ones). Unsupported constructs Unsupported functions General purpose functions: Aggregation functions: Mathematical functions: List functions: Documentation Community More
Tutorials overview Articles within the tutorials section serve as real-world examples of using
Memgraph. These articles tend to provide the user with a reasonably-sized
dataset and some example queries that showcase how to use Memgraph on that
particular dataset. We encourage all Memgraph users to go through at least
one of the tutorials as they can also serve as a verification that Memgraph
is successfully installed on your system. So far we have covered the following topics with basic tutorials: If you are looking for more complex tutorials that include the usage of database
functionalities such as query modules, then take a look at these: Documentation Community More
Reference guide overview Memgraph supports most of the commonly used constructs of the language. The
reference guide contains the details of implemented features. Additionally,
not yet supported features of the language are listed. Cypher query language Cypher is a declarative graph query language that allows for expressive and efficient data querying in a property graph. It aims to be intuitive and easy to learn while
providing a powerful interface for working with graph-based data.  Configuration settings Memgraph can be configured by editing the Memgraph configuration file or by including another configuration file.  Indexing An index stores additional information on certain types of data, so that retrieving said data becomes more efficient. Built-in graph algorithms Memgraph comes with custom-built algorithms that are implemented using C++: Filtering variable-length paths, Breadth-first search, and Weighted shortest path. Query modules Memgraph supports extending the query language with user-written procedures.
These procedures are grouped into modules, which can then be loaded either on startup or later on. NetworkX Memgraph includes a set of Python query modules based on the NetworkX library of algorithms.
You can find more information about all the available algorithms in the NetxorkX reference guide. Machine learning Memgraph TensorFlow op wraps the high-performance Memgraph client for use with TensorFlow,
allowing natural data transfer between Memgraph and TensorFlow at any point of the model. Backup Memgraph comes with a couple of queries that allow you to safely make a backup of the files containing its data. User privileges Memgraph comes with the option of granting, denying, or revoking a certain set of privileges to users or groups of users. Authentication and authorization Memgraph supports authentication and (optional) authorization using a custom-built external auth module.
To learn more visit: Audit log Memgraph supports all query audit logging. When enabled, the audit log contains records of all queries executed on the database. Replication Memgraph comes with a couple of queries that allow you to safely make a backup of the files containing its data.
Memgraph supports replication and allows you to create a cluster of nodes running Memgraph instances.  Documentation Community More

Database functionalities overview Articles within this section serve as a cookbook for getting
things done as fast as possible. These articles tend to provide a step-by-step
guide on how to use certain Memgraph features or solve a particular problem. Import data Data can be imported from CSV files using the CSV Import Tool or by using Cypher queries.
To learn more visit: Query modules Memgraph supports extending the query language with user-written procedures.
These procedures are grouped into modules, which can then be loaded either on startup or later on.
To learn more about query modules take a look at the following guides: Inspect and profile Cypher queries Memgraph also enables you to inspect and profile the execution of a query and get a detailed report
on how the query's plan behaved. Take a look at the guides: Machine learning Memgraph TensorFlow op wraps the high-performance Memgraph client for use with TensorFlow,

Other features The following sections describe some of the other supported features. String operators Apart from comparison and concatenation operators openCypher provides special
string operators for easier matching of substrings: Parameters When automating the queries for Memgraph, it comes in handy to change only
some parts of the query. Usually, these parts are values which are used for
filtering results or similar, while the rest of the query remains the same. Parameters allow reusing the same query, but with different parameter values.
The syntax uses the $ symbol to designate a parameter name. We don't allow
old Cypher parameter syntax using curly braces. For example, you can parameterize
filtering a node property: You can use parameters instead of any literal in the query, but not instead of
property maps even though that is allowed in standard openCypher. Following
example is illegal in Memgraph: To use parameters with Python driver use following syntax: To use parameters which names are integers you will need to wrap parameters in
a dictionary and convert them to strings before running a query: To use parameters with some other driver please consult appropriate
documentation. CASE Conditional expressions can be expressed in openCypher language by simple and
generic form of CASE expression. A simple form is used to compare an expression
against multiple predicates. For the first matched predicate result of the
expression provided after the THEN keyword is returned.  If no expression is
matched value following ELSE is returned is provided, or null if ELSE is not
used: In generic form, you don't need to provide an expression whose value is compared to
predicates, but you can list multiple predicates and the first one that evaluates
to true is matched: Inspecting and profiling queries The EXPLAIN and PROFILE operators can be used to inspect and profile a
particular Cypher query in order to see its internal representation and the
way it behaves during execution. For a detailed look at using EXPLAIN and PROFILE, take a look at the guides: Documentation Community More

Getting started This article outlines the basic steps necessary to query a running Memgraph database instance from Memgraph Lab. Prerequisites Before you proceed with the guide, make sure that you have: Connecting to the database Make sure that Memgraph is running and open Memgraph Lab.
If you are starting with a fresh database instance, you don't have to change any of the options. If you fail to connect, make sure that your database instance is up and running.
If the Host address is wrong, take a look at the Docker note in the installation guide.  Executing queries Now, you can execute Cypher queries on Memgraph.
Open the Query tab, located in the left sidebar, copy the following query and press the Run query button: The query above will create 2 nodes in the database, one labeled "User" with name
"Alice" and the other labeled "Software" with name "Memgraph". It will also
create a relationship that "Alice" likes "Memgraph". To find created nodes and relationships, execute the following query: Where to next? To learn more about the Cypher language, visit the Cypher manual or Memgraph Playground for interactive guides.
For real-world examples of how to use Memgraph, we strongly suggest going through one of the available Tutorials.

Frequently asked questions What is Memgraph? Memgraph is a native fully distributed in-memory graph database built to handle
real-time use-cases at enterprise scale. Memgraph supports strongly-consistent
ACID transactions; and uses the standardized openCypher query language for
structuring, manipulating, and exploring data. Does being in-memory mean that Memgraph will lose all data upon system failure or restart? No. Memgraph uses RAM as the primary storage for data. However, Memgraph
continuously backs up data to disk with transaction logs and periodic
snapshots. On restart, Memgraph uses the snapshot and log files to recover its
state to what it was before shutting down. How far have you scaled your system? It depends on the dataset and the queries, in other words, the workload. On a
single machine, Memgraph scales up to the size of the main memory. In a
distributed system, the graph is automatically repartitioned in the background
to improve query execution time and scalability. Can Memgraph be deployed in the cloud? Yes, Memgraph can be deployed in the cloud. Memgraph is designed to be
portable, but currently available only on the x86_64 architecture. All standard
Linux distributions like CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu, RedHat are supported. Memgraph
is also available on Docker. For any other platforms, please drop us an email
at tech@memgraph.com or get in touch with our team
on our Forum. What does the hardware footprint look like? Memgraph uses ~50GB to store 100M nodes and 100M edges with one label and one
property per each node and an edge type and one property per edge. Does Memgraph offer a cloud graph database as a service? Yes, we offer fully-managed Memgraph on our cloud infrastructure as a service.
For more details please visit our cloud pages.
In addition, Memgraph Playground is a
testing environment where you can play with various graph datasets. Do you support Tinkerpop API stacks? Memgraph doesn't support the Tinkerpop API stack because Tinkerpop is highly
dependent on the Java stack. Memgraph is implemented in C/C++/Assembly with
openCypher and the Bolt protocol as an interface. We have considered Tinkerpop
integration, but at the moment it's not one of our highest priorities. How do you interface with the system? Memgraph supports the openCypher query language to
query the database instance. It's a declarative query language designed to
query graphs. Communication between clients and the database is done via the
Bolt protocol. For the list of supported
programming languages please take a look
here. How do you upgrade? To do software upgrades the whole cluster has to go down. Before that data has
to be migrated to a cluster with the newer version of Memgraph. At the moment,
we offer no downtime upgrades, but that's a feature which is high on our
priority list. What we do offer is support when the upgrade is needed. Can you implement custom Cypher procedures? Memgraph supports extending the query language with user-written procedures.
These procedures are grouped into modules, which can then be loaded on startup.
Query modules can be implemented by using the Python API or C API.
Take a look at our guide Implement custom query modules. Why is my Memgraph instance relatively slow? Label indexing is not enabled by default in Memgraph, i.e., Memgraph will not
automatically index labeled data. Therefore, it is up to the user to perform the
indexing explicitly. Visit the Reference guide
to find out more about creating indexes. What are the Cypher implementation differences compared to Neo4j? Although we try to implement openCypher query language as closely to the
language reference as possible, we had to make some changes to enhance the
user experience. You can find the differences listed in the Cypher manual. Documentation Community More
